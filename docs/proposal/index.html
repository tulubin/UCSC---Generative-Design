    <p>
        This game will be a bullet hell game with randomly generated scenes.
        The game engine will probably be unity2D.
        Artist statement
        All assignments we had done so far doesn't really be called the game. It’s to put what I have learned into a
        real game making project, which is why I want to create a game that involved multiple techniques we learned in
        this class.
        I want to stick with the idea of generative which means my game will be something not pre-designed but randomly
        generated.
        Since the time and resources are limited, in order to create a good game experience, an action game can be a
        good option. So my plan is to create an action game that will let the player feel interested in controlling
        character and responding to the dangers.
        However, this game is not particularly inspired by other existing games.
        A description of the experience itself
        The game experience should start at a low difficulty level, and according to the time passed, it will get
        harder.
        This randomly generated game scenes will relative to the aggressiveness of BGM.
        One of the top goals is to dynamically adjust the difficulty depending on the player’s game skills, in other
        words, if the player keep being hit, the difficulty will be reduced.
        Technical details
        This game will be using Perlin Noise for scenes generation and maybe Genetic Algorithms for difficulty control.
        Since this is an actual game, both technics will be much complex comparing to what we did in class.
        Schedule
        1st Week: Implementing randomly generated scenes with Perlin Noise and based on BGM and add physical system so
        the player can actually move around and avoiding dangers.
        2nd Week: Implementing difficulty controlled depending on how good the player is, and improve gameplay.
        3rd Week: Implementing optional techniques such as importing any music to generate the game, add more kind of
        bullets and add some player equipment/boosts.
